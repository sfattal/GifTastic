## Instructions

1. When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
2. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.
3. Under every gif, its rating is diplayed (PG, G, so on).
4. All the data is provided by the GIPHY API.
5. There is a form on the page that takes the value from a user input and adds it as a button. Clicking this button will display gifs from the category of the user input provided to create the button.
